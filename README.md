## Overview: 
### This project was tasked with the goal of using SQL query language to assess Pewlett Hackard's staff and their retirement status.

# Results: 
## Based on the data we were able to pull, using the six different csv files, we were able to deduce that there is a large number of employees getting ready to retire. A list of names was created to identify those individuals, as well as, the departments that they belonged to. That information was shared with HR. For this report, we will only be sharing the number of employees soon leaving their departments due to retirement.
### 25916 =Senior Engineer
### 24926 =Senior Staff
### 9285 = Engineer
### 7636 = Staff
### 3603 = Technique Leader

# Summary:
## To summarize, with the 72,458 employees soon becoming eligible for retirement, we have gathered a list of eligible employees who could fill those vacancies. This should ease Pewlett Hackard's transition as it could be more cost efficient to fill-in entry level to mid-level positions while promoting from within.
